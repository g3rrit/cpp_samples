Named definitions are of the form ``name = regexp ;``
where ``name`` is an identifier that consists of letters, digits and underscores,
and ``regexp`` is a regular expression.
With ``-F`` ``--flex-syntax`` option named definitions are also of the form ``name regexp``.
Each name should be defined before it is used.
